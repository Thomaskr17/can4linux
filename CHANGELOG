svn 153:
	new prototype functions to easier support new CAN hardware
	genericfuncs.c, generichardware.h
svn 144:
	Phyton binding and example added

4.0: svn 139:
	- can4linux with support for CAN FD (in virtual CAN mode so far)
	- examples can_send and receive-select with CAN FD support
svn 134:
	first version with a CAN bus simulation mode
	implementing a virtual CAN bus
svn 130: 
	TX error counter and Rx error counter were exchanged in /proc ..
svn 129: 
	implement CAN error counters 
	/proc/sys/dev/Can/TxErrCounter
	/proc/sys/dev/Can/RxErrCounter
	(for sja1000 up to now)
svn 127: 
	allow only the first process opening a device to use
	ioctl() functions like CAN_StopChip(), CAN_StartChip()
	CAN_ChipReset() or CAn_TxFiFoInit().
svn 88: 
	Release of the Contemporary Controls CANPCI-CO/DN
	with LED cotrol
svn 80: 
	First version supporting the Contemporary Controls CAN Interface 
	CANPCI-CO/DN, one channel CAN/CANopen and DeviceNet 
svn 70:
	removed some errors in the MCP2515 code
svn 65:
	Fork of the SPI connected Microchip MCP2515 to TARGET=MCP2515SPI
	which is controlled by the kernel SPI sub layer.
	Still existing are TARGET=SSV_MCP2515 and AuR_MCP2515
	where the SPI controller is directly used by can4linux.
svn 62:
	corrected register access Makros for TARGET KVASER_PCICAN
svn 59:
	Support for a second target using ATMEL ARM9 with a external CAN
	via SPI, the Microchip MCP2515, using direct SPI access.

	the driver loadable module name is now can4linux
	to avoid conflicts with Socket CAN modules.

3.5.7: svn 55
	Support for FlexCAN on imx25 with /dev/can0 and /dev/can1
	testet on Ka-Ro TX25 module
	Both CAN modules are working with internal bus-clock (66.5 MHz)
	#define CAN_IS_USING_BUS_CLOCK is set
svn 53:
	finally got FlexCAN on imx35 working with the external clock
	if CAN_IS_USING_BUS_CLOCK is _not_ defined
	BUT take care, the default clock as shown in
	/proc/cpu/clocks is
	ckie-0            24576000
	which is not a good frequency to generate CAN bit rates.
	We used exactly 24.00 Mhz and this is table for in imx35flexcan.h 
svn 51:
	new board supported: RTD ECAN1000 PC104 board
	http://www.rtd.com (Will Tate <willytate@users.sourceforge.net>)
svn 49:
	update Kvaser CANPCI to use current pci scan function
svn 45:
	adopted to the changed syctl of kernel 2.6.34
	can be used with SUSE 11.3 now.
3.5.6 - svn: 40; 
        New Target  FlexCAN on imx35
        =======
        because svn on SourceForge is used, we don't provide a new
        tgz archive for every checkin.
        The CHANGELOG therefore lists the version number available
        at /prc/sys/dev/Can/version
        and the svn revision number
3.5.5 - New Target PCM3680 and JANZ_PCIL (Janz AG)
3.5.4 - New Targets, PCM9890 and EMS CPC_PCI2(4 channel PCI)
	ATCANMINI_PELICAN reactivated
3.5.3 - For some reasons, parameter location changed from
	/proc/sys/Can/* to /proc/sys/dev/Can/*
      - support for CAN_MAX_OPEN for the ATMEL AT91SAM9263
      - common code base now for most CAN chips supported
      - support for the new CPC_PCI with up to four CAN controllers
      	still preliminary, need to combine the _old_ and _new_
      	in any combination
      - new TARGET=MMC_SJA1000, ARM AT91SAM9269 with 3 external
        SJA1000 with multiplexed memory access.
      - new TARGET=SSV_MCP2515
3.5.2 - More than one process can now open the driver
	This number is defined at compile time.
	Can be set in the Makefile or in defs.h 
	e.g. CAN_MAX_OPEN=4
	This feature is currently on the sja1000 only supported
	and only tested with the CPC-PCI interface

      - ioctl return value changed to 0 on successful return
	extended selfreception flag from 'per channel (minor)' to
	  'per process'
      - prohibit setting a new bitttime if the channel was already opened
	  by another process, setting the same bitrate as the first
	  process is permitted
      - this version should at least compile up to kernel 2.6.22
	testet on 2.6.22 quad core
3.4.6 - udev support
3.4.5 - Tested on SMP and 64 Bit X86 machines
	made some 64 bit type adoptions
3.4.4 - removed Bug in mcf5282 when transmitting from ISR
3.4.3 - removed warnings
	ignoring return value of 'copy_to_user'
	with kernel version 2.6.16.21
      - introducing general DEFS compiler settings.
	used for e.g. -Wno-undef
3.4.2 - Support for EMS CPC-104 (PC104 containing SJA1000)
        changed type of can_base[] to __iomem (contains virtual address)
3.4.1 - bug in mcf5282 interrupt handling which selfreceived messages 
        removed
3.4   - new release with changing the directory structure 
        all files without can_ prefix, because we are in the can4linux
        sub directory
      - read() and write() are now blocking per default
      - getting the time stamp information for received messages
        in canmsg_t can be switched off if not needed
        (saves some us ISR time)
      - supported controllers and CAN interface boards now additional:
        Kvaser PCIcan-Q 
        MPL VCMA9 
        Analog Devices BlackFin 537
        Freescale 5282

3.3.6 - read() is now a blocking read if not opened with O_NONBLOCK
3.3.5 - new ioctl() direkt setting of BTR registers
	each value is possible now using this ioctl()
3.3.4 - two new ioctl() configuration commands for sja1000 devices
	self reception mode - each message sent is delivered back
	      in the rx queue
	listen only mode (CAN controller doesn't acknowledge frames)
3.3.3 - removed cli()/sti() code sections
      - use __iomem 	

3.3 - can4linux for LINUX Kernel build 2.6 in new directury
      more simple directory structure and using the kernel module build

3.2 - Changed Structures compatible between all hardware variants
      Modified and extended to support Generic i82527 cards and
      the SBS PC7compact DINrail mounted industry PC
      by FOCUS Software Engineering Pty Ltd <www.focus-sw.com>

3.1 - Added support for SSV TRM/816 by Sven Geggus <geggus@iitb.fraunhofer.de>
      new hardware configuration CAN_INDEXED_PORT_IO used on Elan
    - updated examples (esp. can_send.c to new 3.0 CanStatusPar_struct.

3.0 - going further into compiling the driver directly for the hardware
      specified in Makefile
      Removing old code
        - the old 82cC200 is not longer supported
          only sja1000 in PeliCAN mode
        - begin canceling support for OS < 2.4.0
      new pci detection code, using improved linux pci bios features
      PCI cards should be detected in other PCI busses as 0 as well
      - Changed the CanSja1000Status_par_t to a more generic one 
        CanStatusPar_t

2.6 - 2.5 had a very serious bug. Because of wrong index definitions into
      the Sysctl array, it was possible to set the Base address and IRQ
      to 0 when using the CPC-PCI board

2.5 - removed bug in can_ioctl(); thanks to stefan.panwinkler@contec.at
      Suport for Advantech Pcm-3680

2.4 - because the driver must be compiled for a specific TARGET
      now some "configuration" values are preset at compile time:
      IOModel, Outc, VendOpt.
      nevertheless, Outc can be overwritten
    - Makefile checks for supported TARGET


2.3 - /proc/sys/CAN/version now contains also the target name can4linux
    is compiled for
    - ioctl() get status returns additional the size and 
      number of rx and tx messages in buffers
    - improved tx buffer handling 
    - Support I+ME PcSlimLine ISA card with SJA1000

!!!!!!!!
2.2 - may be somethg wrong with this version with the CPC-PCI support !!!!
!!!!!Unterst.Controller: SJA1000
     Karten: ATCANMINI_BASIC, ATCANMINI_PELICAN
	CPC_PCI, IXXAT_PCI03
 
2.1 - freigegeben
     2.0 - (nicht released)
     erste Version abgerüstet,
     Übersetzbar ohne LDDK und nur für einen Controller-typ,
     bzw. Kartentyp, Auswählbar zur Kompile-Zeit,
     dadurch für embedded Systeme verwendbar (benötigt weniger Speicher)
