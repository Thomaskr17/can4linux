Kvaser PCIcan-Q 
PCIcan-Q has four CAN controllers.

PCIcan board uses the S5920 from AMCC as PCI controller.
The PCI controller is responsible for address decoding and interrupt steering.

The PCI controller
can decode up to 5 different address areas,
three of which are used by the PCIcan.

                                 0 - 0x1f: SJA1000 #1
                                 0x20 - 0x3F: SJA1000 #2
                                 0x40 - 0x5F: SJA1000 #3

Address area number 1,
the one used for the SJA1000's,
is further subdivided into four areas
of 32 bytes each;
one for each (possible) SJA1000.

The S5920 is operated in pass-thru operation, passive mode.
To configure the address areas,
the value 0x80808080
should be written
into the PCI PASSTHRU CONFIGURATION REGISTER (PTCR) register.
This sets all regions to use 0 wait
states and to use the PTADR signal.

The PCIcan uses one PCI bus interrupt, INTA#.
It is asserted whenever one
or more
SJA1000's
have their interrupts active.
To reset an active interrupt,
read the interrupt status register in all present SJA1000s
- the interrupt of the corresponding SJA1000 will then
automatically clear.
To check the status of the interrupt line,
test the INTERRUPT ASSERTED bit (number 23)
in the INTCSR register in the S5920.
To enable or disable interrupts from the PCIcan,
use the ADD-ON INTERRUPT PIN ENABLE (bit 13)
in the INTCSR register in the S5920.






Xilinx FPGA

The Xilinx FPGA implements a few registers.
Address offset   Register   Usage
  0-6                       Reserved, do not use
  7              VERINT     Bit 7 - 4 contains the revision number of the FPGA
                            configuration. 15 is the first revision,
                            14 is the next, and so on.

The current FPGA revision number is 14
(which is read from the VERINT register as 1110xxxx).
Future revisions (13, 12, 11, ...) will remain compatible with revision 14.



PCI Configuration Data
The following data are configured automatically
into the S5920 PCI controller
when power is applied to the card.
 Item                           Value
 Vendor Id                      0x10e8
 Device Id                      0x8406 (for all PCIcan boards)
 Revision Id                    0
 Class Code                     0xffff00 (means:
 					no base class code defined for device)
 Subsystem Vendor Id            0
 Subsystem Device Id            0

Configuration of the SJA1000

Setting the OCR register to 0xDA is a good idea.
