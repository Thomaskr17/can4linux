can4linux can now be used with kernel 2.6. (and of course 3.x)
It's not yet integrated into the kernel drivers directory tree and 
configuration is not yet supported bei the kernel configuration tools
like menuconfig or xconfig.

just copy the directory elsewhere, edit the Makefile to select your hardware
and type make. 
You have to install the driver manually, mostly using 
# insmod can.ko
or 
# make load

Tested at port GmbH are the ISA board AT-CAN-MINI and the PCI CPC-PCI.
Reported to work:
IXXAT_PCI03, SBS_PC7, PCM3680

Please provide the device inodes manually if required (not using devfs).

Using the ISA board, addresses and irq must be set manually in /proc/sys/Can.
(using ./utils/cansetup )
