When using the driver with TRM/816 Hardware by SSV embedded Systems
(http://www.ssv-embedded.de) the DIL-NET-PC IO-Addresses and IRQ-lines
have to be set up first.

As this is not exactly a CAN-Driver issue I did not integrate this into the
CAN-Bus driver!

Instead I created a small utility called "dnpsetup" which has to be called
_before_ the device driver is loaded.
It can be found in the trm816/ sub-directory.
